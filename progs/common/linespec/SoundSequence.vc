//** Actors for independantly playing sound sequences in a map.
//**
//** A SoundSequence actor has two modes of operation:
//**
//**   1. If the sound sequence assigned to it has a slot, then a separate
//**      SoundSequenceSlot actor is spawned (if not already present), and
//**      this actor's sound sequence is added to its list of choices. This
//**      actor is then destroyed, never to be heard from again. The sound
//**      sequence for the slot is automatically played on the new
//**      SoundSequenceSlot actor, and it should at some point execute the
//**      randomsequence command so that it can pick one of the other
//**      sequences to play. The slot sequence should also end with restart
//**      so that more than one sequence will have a chance to play.
//**
//**      In this mode, it is very much like world $ambient sounds defined
//**      in SNDINFO but more flexible.
//**
//**   2. If the sound sequence assigned to it has no slot, then it will play
//**      the sequence when activated and cease playing the sequence when
//**      deactivated.
//**
//**      In this mode, it is very much like point $ambient sounds defined
//**      in SNDINFO but more flexible.
//**
//** To assign a sound sequence, set the SoundSequence's first argument to
//** the ID of the corresponding environment sequence you want to use. If
//** that sequence is a multiple-choice sequence, then the second argument
//** selects which choice it picks.
