1. Introduction
*****************************************************************************

    Vavoom is a source port based on the sources of Doom, Heretic, Hexen and
  "a little bit" from Quake. Supported platforms are DOS, Windows and LINUX.
  A dedicated server also can be compiled on OpenBSD and possibly on other
  UNIX systems, but this may require some changes.
    If you find any bugs, feel free to report them.

*****************************************************************************
2. Requirements
*****************************************************************************

Vavoom System Requirements:
     - Pentium processor or better
     - 32 MB RAM
     - Optional: Sound card
     - Optional: CD-ROM
     - Windows version: DirectX 7 (http://www.microsoft.com/directx)

*** IMPORTANT! Vavoom requires a floating point processor.
Systems that do not have an FPU installed will not run Vavoom -- at all.

  To play Vavoom you need the main wad file from one of the following games:
     - Doom shareware
     - Registered Doom
     - Ultimate Doom
     - Doom 2: Hell on Earth
     - Doom 2: TNT Evilution
     - Doom 2: The Plutonia experiment
     - Heretic shareware
     - Heretic registered
     - Hexen
     - Strife shareware
     - Strife
  If you have multiple IWADs, you can use command line params -doom, -doom2,
-tnt, -plutonia, -heretic, -hexen or -strife to look for IWADs only for that
game. Hexen requires a wad file from version 1.1.

*****************************************************************************
3. Installation
*****************************************************************************

==============================================================================
3.1 Installing DOS/Windows binaries
==============================================================================

  First choose a directory, where you will place Vavoom - an existing Doom,
Heretic and/or Hexen directory or new directory. If you decide to create a
new directory, you must copy here the main game wad file. Then unarchive here
the binaries.

==============================================================================
3.2 Linux/UNIX installation
==============================================================================

In order to compile and run Vavoom under Linux, you need the following:

Compiler and tools:
    * GNU C++ Compiler, GNU make (every LINUX user must have them)
Libraries:
    * zlib
    * libpng
    * libjpeg
    * Allegro 4.0 (http://alleg.sourceforge.net)
  or
    * SDL 1.2 (http://www.libsdl.org) and SDL_mixer 1.2
  (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/).
    * OpenGL: OpenGL implementation from your video card's manufacturer
  or MESA (http://www.mesa3d.org) and X-Windows development libraries.
    * AllegroGL (http://allegrogl.sourceforge.net) if you want to use OpenGL
  with Allegro driver.
Optional:
    * OpenAL (http://www.openal.org), the source must be checked out from the
  CVS repository. You will find info on this on OpenAL website or at Creative
  developer centre (http://developer.creative.com).
    * libvorbis (http://www.vorbis.com)
    * libmad (http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/)
    * mikmod (http://mikmod.raphnet.net/)
    * FLAC (http://flac.sourceforge.net/)

  And of course the Vavoom sources.

Step by step:
-------------

  1. Unpack the Vavoom source package:

    tar xvjf vavoom-1.22.tar.bz2

  If you got the zip file instead of tarball then you must run fixunix.sh to
convert text files to UNIX format:

    ./fixunix.sh

  2. Run the configure script:

    ./configure

  Here are some configure parameters you may want to use:

    --prefix=PATH       - specify prefix of installation. Default is /usr/local
    --with-allegro      - use Allegro for hardware API. This is the default.
    --with-sdl          - use SDL for hardware API.
    --without-opengl    - compile without OpenGL support.
    --without-openal    - compile without OpenAL support.

  3. Run make in the main directory.

    make

  This will compile the Vavoom executable, utilities, progs and will build the
additional wad files.

  4. Then you install it:

    su -c "make install"

  This will install Vavoom into {prefix}/games/Vavoom.

  5. Change to this directory and copy the main .wad file here or create
a symbolic link to it:

        cd {prefix}/games/Vavoom
        cp <where-your-wad-file-is> .
   or:
        cd {prefix}/games/Vavoom
        ln -s <where-your-wad-file-is> .

  Also make sure that the file/symbolic link name is in lower case.

  6. If using allegro, run the Allegro setup utility, setup your sound and music
card, save the changes and then copy allegro.cfg into Vavoom directory.

==============================================================================
3.3 Other source code compiling information for developers
==============================================================================

For DOS you need
  Compiler and tools:
      * DJGPP (http://www.delorie.com/djgpp) with gcc, make and bash
  Libraries:
      * zlib
      * libpng
      * libjpeg
      * Allegro 4.0 (http://alleg.sourceforge.net) and later.
      * OpenGL version: MESA (http://www.mesa3d.org) and Allegro driver for
    MESA (http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/7259/)

For Windows you need:
  Compiler and tools:
      * MinGW and MSYS (http://www.mingw.org).
  or:
      * Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0.
      * DJGPP (http://www.delorie.com/djgpp) - used to compile asm files.
  Libraries:
      * zlib
      * libpng
      * libjpeg
      * DirectX 7 SDK (http://www.microsoft.com/directx), already included
    in Builder but some headers needed by DirectMusic are missing. In Allegro
    website (http://alleg.sourceforge.net) you will find a minimal version of
    DirectX 7 SDK.
      * EAX 2.0 SDK (http://developer.creative.com/).
      * OpenAL SDK (http://developer.creative.com), you must create directory
    AL in your compilers include directory and copy OpenAL include files here.
      * libvorbis (http://www.vorbis.com)
      * libmad (http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/)
      * mikmod (http://mikmod.raphnet.net/)
      * FLAC (http://flac.sourceforge.net/)

  You can also compile with MSVC, you will find the workspace and project files
in the 'msvc' subdirectory.

*****************************************************************************
4. Starting a net game
*****************************************************************************

  First about drivers. The DOS version supports IPX, Beame & Whiteside TCP/IP
and MPATH TCP/IP drivers. MPATH driver needs a launcher, the one from Quake
works fine (because the drivers are taken from Quake sources). Serial driver
is not fixed (if you need this, please let me know or otherwise I will not
fix it).

The Windows version supports Winsock TCP/IP and Winsock IPX driers. The Linux
version only has the TCP/IP driver.

  The default socket port is 26000. It can be changed in the console with
the command "port <port>".

  Now network game can be launched from the main menu. It's Quake-like, so you
should not have problems with it.

  Here is a list of the most important server console variables and commands
for dedicated server operators.

Server console variables:
-------------------------

    DeathMatch          - 0 - cooperative, other - deathmatch, in Doom
                            1 - like was param -deathmatch
                            2 - like was -altdeath - items and weapons are
                          respawning
                            3 - like 2, but monsters are respawning very fast
                          and they are attacking each other - total nightmare
    NoMonsters          - 0 - enable, 1 - disable monsters;
    TimeLimit           - Replaces command line param -time, sets time (in
                     minutes), after which the level will automatically end,
                     0 for no limit, works only in deathmatch.
    HostName            - Name, listed in server list and that can be used to
                     connect to this server.
    Skill               - Game skill, 0 - very easy, 4 - nightmare

Server console commands:
------------------------

    MaxPlayers [<players>]

  Changes maximum number of players. It can only be executed when the server is
not running, for dedicated servers it's only executed on command line.

    Map <mapname>

  Shuts down the current server and spawns a new one in the specified map. As
you understand all the clients are dropped.

*****************************************************************************
5. Command line parameters
*****************************************************************************

  All the console commands can be specified at the command line by prefixing
them with the + symbol, they will be executed after executing basev/startup.vs.

Debugging
---------

-DEBUG creates a debug file basev/debug.txt on DOS and Windows,
~/.vavoom/debug.txt on Unix-like systems with all the console messages.
-debug

-STARTTIME sets start time, it doesn't works in the LINUX version or
dedicated servers
-starttime <time>

*****************************************************************************
7. Version history
*****************************************************************************

==============================================================================
Version 1.1
==============================================================================

* Replaced immediate console command execution with command buffer (like in
 Quake).
* Replaced old message with 5 notify messages.
* Created switches script.
* All games can have extended level structure with ACS scripts.
* Reworked all sound, music and CD-audio stuff.
* Created new sound script with more info than SNDINFO, this one replaces
 builtin table of sounds.
* Fixed problem with long sound lumps.
* Added function S_PlayTillDone for Doom quit sounds.
* Windows version now supports 3D sound (if Your hardware supports it).
* No more builtin sound sequence list - now registering all sequences from
 script.
* CD now works on Windows and also on Linux (thanks to sources if Quake).
* Some other bugfixes and improvements.

==============================================================================
Version 1.2
==============================================================================

* Some structures are replaced with C++ classes, which makes coding easier.
* Functions, that takes most of the execution time (R_DrawColumn, R_DrawSpan
 and RunFunction) now are in assembler (DOS and LINUX versions only).
* Improved dehacked support. Now it handles everything, that it can. It is
 also added to makeinfo utility, which means that now you can create PROGS
 with changes of dehacked patch.
* Removed some command line params (-playdemo, -record, -width, -height, ..).
 Most of them are replaced with console commands that can be specified in
 command line by adding + before them (like in Quake).
* Some bug fixes.

==============================================================================
Version 1.3
==============================================================================

* DOS network drivers ported to DJGPP and moved into main executable.
* Fixed chat.
* Fixed multiplayer intermission.
* Totally rewrote network protocol. Added multicast server. This means that
 all client messages are sent only to server and server forwards them to
 other players. Why that's for? Whel, in the beginning, when I tried to run
 4 players on IPX, it seemed that it runs one tic per second. By adding
 -extratics situation got a little bit better, but not by much. Now 4 players
 on IPX really can play. No need to use -dup option so I decided to remove it.
 -extratics option was removed, when I added ACK mechanism.

==============================================================================
Version 1.4 BETA
==============================================================================

* Added almost all Quake network drivers.
* Client/server architecture. As You understand, this is a really BIG change.
* Removed support for old demos. New demos is not done yet :-(
* Real random numbers.
* Net game launching from console.

==============================================================================
Version 1.4
==============================================================================

* In-game joining (also in single player).
* Fixed savegames, intermission, floor texture changes, other minor bugs.

==============================================================================
Version 1.5 BETA
==============================================================================

* Replacing fixed point with floating point, in progs everything is replaced,
 in executable some drawing functions still use them because conversation from
 float to int is very expensive.
* Fixed bug with framerate bigger than 35 FPS (caused delays between input
 and actual action)
* Improved Windows keyboard input
* I hope that I fixed problem with sound in Windows version
* Added screen resolution menu
* Server's mobj baseline is now saved in save game

==============================================================================
Version 1.5
==============================================================================

 the following lines:

    extern int CheckTextureNumForName(string name);
    extern int TextureNumForName(string name);
    extern int CheckFlatNumForName(string name);
    extern int FlatNumForName(string name);

  If texture or flat is not found, Check... functions returns -1, but
 functions without Check will abort program with error message.

==============================================================================
Version 1.666 BETA 2
==============================================================================

* Disabled testing of lighting effects, in Hexen MAP01 it took 62% of
 execution time.
* Support for different sprite types.

* New type - name: The name of an item in Vavoom (such as the name of a
 function, state, class, etc). Names are stored as a 16-bit index into the
 global name table.
* New type - bool. It's implemented as a bitfield. That means that in structs
 and classes a list of sequential bool properties will be merged into a single
 32 bit integer so it's a good idea to group them together.
* Changed states syntax. Function pointer replaced with state code.
